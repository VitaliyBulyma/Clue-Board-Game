## Description
Create a game board using the Vue.js framework. Game board for the project is Clue.

## What is done so far
- Start game where it ask for number of player and their corresponding colour for the game
- The main design of the board game is complete
- Many components for the game board:
    - Tile (Regular yellow tile)
    - Room Tile
    - Door Tile
    - Warp Tile
    - Goal Tile
    - Start Tile
    - Empty Tile
- Die component to decide how many steps the player can make
- Player component to know where you are at on the board 
- Suggestion component (functionality incomplete)
- Have a blue shade where the player can move on the possible tiles

## Future plans
- When player moves to a room have the suggestion component be turned on (make a suggestion like in the real clue board game)
- Weapon component
- Character component (NPC only their for suggestion)
- Moving the character and weapon when the suggestion is made
- Decide on how the distribution on the cards each player can have (have a message system or some other idea)
- Win condition (Where a character, weapon, and room is pulled from the deck of cards)
- Lose condition
